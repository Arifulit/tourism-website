This national park, located in Madhupur Upazila of Tangail, Bangladesh, is a haven for nature enthusiasts and adventure seekers alike. The park spans an area of approximately 84,366 hectares and is home to a wide variety of flora and fauna, making it a hotspot for wildlife conservation and forest biodiversity.

        One of the unique aspects of Madhupur National Park is the presence of tribal communities within and around the park. These tribal communities, such as the Garos, Kochs, and Dwarfs, have been living in harmony with nature for generations. Their deep-rooted connection to the land and their traditional knowledge play a crucial role in the conservation efforts of the park.</p>
