    <p style="width: 60%; font-size: 20px;text-align: justify;font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">The Sagardighi, a historic dighi located in Tangail district, is believed to have been excavated by the king of the sea to solve the water crisis of his subjects. This magnificent water body holds immense historical significance and is shrouded in local legends and myths.

        It covers an expansive area of about 13 acres and was dug during the Pala period under the leadership of Sagar Raja. One of the striking architectural features of Sagardighi is the ruins of the shan-bound ghat, situated on its western bank. These ruins are believed to have been the residence of the king, adding an air of mystery and intrigue to the dighi.
        
        On the north and south sides of the dighi, you can find two educational institutions, Sagar Dighi High School and Sagardighi Dakhil Madrasa, further emphasizing the cultural and historical significance of this site.
        
        Local legends and myths surround Sagardighi, adding to its allure. It is said that after the dighi was dug, there was no water in it until the queen was lowered into the dighi as per a dream. Miraculously, the dighi was filled with water, and the queenâ€™s life was saved. Some attribute the rise of water in the dighi to the sacrifice of a pious Kumor named Sagar. Hence, the dighi was named Sagar Kumor Dighi or Sagardighi.
        
        Visiting Sagardighi is like stepping back in time, immersing yourself in history and legends. The architectural features and local myths make this dighi a must-visit destination for history enthusiasts and curious travelers</p>
