This magnificent zamindar house in Tangail offers a plethora of exploration opportunities, with its historical significance and architectural marvel. As you enter through the two huge gates, you will be transported back in time to the ancient civilization and tradition that this house represents.

        Spread over eight acres of land, the Mohera Jamindar Bari is a sight to behold. The three main buildings, along with the naib sahib\'s house, kasari ghar, gomastad\'s house, and three lodges, showcase the grandeur and opulence of the zamindar era. The presence of small parks, a zoo, picnic spots, and boat rides around the landlord\'s house only adds to the charm and allure of this place.
        
        One of the highlights of this zamindar house is the Vishakha Sagar, a dighi that sits majestically before the entrance. It serves as a reminder of the historical significance of this place and its connection to the zamindar\'s legacy. Additionally, the Pasra Pond and Rani Pond located at the back of the main building offer a serene and tranquil setting for visitors to enjoy.</p>
